<p align="justify">
Each year, we are chopping down millions of trees worldwide in the name of producing newspapers for everyone. This inhuman act of ours is amplifying the risk of Global warming. If anyone asks a newspaper company about the number of trees they have chopped for making newspapers, then they will say that they recycle all the newspapers. But in reality, it's impossible to recycle any paper 100% without any waste paper. For that reason, there is always a demand for fresh paper.
Another major problem with our newspaper is it always starts with a piece of bad news. Who wants to start their day with bad news? In addition to that, a newspaper contains so much irrelevant news that it requires a proper filtration system. Each people are unique & require their own set of news. It's where the machine-learning algorithm comes in, and its job is to filter out news for an individual taste. 
In conclusion, Taja Khobor application providing a sustainable way of distributing news to everyone.
